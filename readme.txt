#sel.py



====About====
This script will
1. Use Selenium(python module) to automate javascript loading. To skip having an actual browser open, I used PhantomJS(JS Browser), an invisible browser which can skip graphics rendering.
2. Use Selenium to find necessary HTML text
3. Retrieve Nutrient information from all samples
4. Write results to file output.csv

To Debug Graphics, download and run ChromeDriver instead of PhantomJS in script file not included)


====PreReqs====
1. Install Selenium "pip install selenium" or "pip3 install selenium"
2. PhantomJS (included)
